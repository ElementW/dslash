Dslash
------------

Dslash is a swiss army knife for dealing with Nintendo DS Roms files.  
Its was originally created as a fork from ndstrim.

Features
----------
 - Trim.  It trims nds rom files down to the size specified in the ndsrom 
   headers.
 - In place trimming.  When trimming in place, the rom passed in is the
   rom that is modified.  Since no copying is involved this has the advantage
   of trimming very fast.
 - Detailed Header information.  Extract internal names,titles,etc from rom
   header.
 - Verified to work on both Little Endian (verified on x86) and Big Endian
   (verified on mips) Architectures.:

----------
Usage is provided tersely on the command line as well with the -h option

e.g.
: ./dslash -h

       -h : help
       -p : print ROM information
       -i : trim ROM in place (very fast)
       -d : debug output
       -v : verbose

       -t <filename>  : extract icon from ROM into filename (bmp format)

About DSlash
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DSlash is a "Swiss Army Knife" for dealing with Nintendo DS (.nds) ROM files.
It was originally created as a fork of ndstrim.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Features
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Trim.  DSlash trims .nds files down to the size specified in the ROM
   header.
 - In-place trimming.  When trimming in place, the rom file passed in is the
   rom file that is modified.  Since no copying is involved this has the
   advantage of very fast (nearly instantaneous) operation.
 - Detailed Header information.  Extracts internal names, game titles, etc.
   from the ROM header.
 - Works on both little-endian (verified on x86) and big-endian (verified on
   MIPS) architectures.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage

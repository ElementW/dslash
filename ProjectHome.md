DSlash is a Nintendo DS (.nds) ROM maipulation utility.

It started as a fork of ndstrim, but nearly all of the original code has been rewritten.

DSlash ~~is~~ will eventually be more than just a [ROM trimmer](http://wiki.pocketheaven.com/ROM_stripping). As of now it offers some significant advantages over ndstrim and other ROM tools. See [About DSlash](http://code.google.com/p/dslash/wiki/AboutDSlash) for details.
